# NOVARIS IS NOT OPENSOURCE
However, the jar is not obfuscated wahtsoever so most if not all of the source code can be restored. Always make sure to rat check a mod before using it. This mod will be opensource in the future, so feel free to wait until it is to use it!

This repo is used to store things that need to be changed remotely and releases for the jar.

> [!Caution]
> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. None of the features are against hypixels rules however I am not liable for any punishment directly corelated to the use of Novaris.
